# Creating a new page



When you want to create a new screen, you will first create a new file inside the pages folder, and the file that you created will be responsible for showing the new page you want to show.



11. Right now, we will create a new screen that will be responsible for showing the movie details when the user clicks one of the movie tiles.

12. The first step is to create a new dart file inside the **pages** folder, and we will call it **movie_page.dart**.



13. In order to create a new page, we will create a new widget of type stateless widget and we will call it **MoviePage**. Also, don’t forget to import **material.dart** file. Also, note that we started with the **Scaffold** widget, every time you create a new page, you will be used the **Scaffold** widget.

    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    
    class MoviePage extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold();
      }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** In our case, we don’t need a **setState** method that why we used the stateless widget, if your page needs a **setState** method use the stateful widget instead.



14. Inside the **movie_page.dart**, remove the empty **Scaffold** widget, and replace it with this widget tree.

    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    
    class MoviePage extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text(
              'Toy Story',
              style: TextStyle(
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ),
          body: Column(
            children: [
              Container(height: 30),
              Image.asset(
                'assets/toy_story.jpeg',
                width: 300,
                height: 400,
                fit: BoxFit.contain,
              ),
              Container(
                alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
                padding: EdgeInsets.all(30),
                child: Text(
                  'Rating: 8/10',
                  style: TextStyle(
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    color: Colors.grey[600],
                    fontSize: 21,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
              Container(
                alignment: Alignment.centerLeft,
                padding: EdgeInsets.only(left: 30, right: 30),
                child: Text(
                  "A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.",
                  style: TextStyle(
                    fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                    color: Colors.grey[700],
                    fontSize: 18,
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```

    > Here, we have a group of widgets that are responsible for drawing the **MoviePage** widget. Also, here we have static data that related to the **Toy Story** movie, later we will make the **MoviePage** dynamic.
